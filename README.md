# Introduction

Dash-CookBook is the repository for sharing various receipts 
to complete different tasks using DashScope APIs and other API
services such as the vector-store DashVector.


## üöÄ DashScope
[DashScope](https://dashscope.aliyun.com/) aims to provide the efficient API services backed by
the state-of-the-art models in different areas, including LLM,
text-to-image, embedding, text-to-speech etc. Visit the official
[DashScope website](https://dashscope.aliyun.com/) for a complete
list of models supported. 


## üöÄ ModelStudio

[ModelStudio(ÁôæÁÇº)](https://bailian.console.aliyun.com/#/home) is a one-stop large-scale model development platform 
based on [DashScope](https://dashscope.aliyun.com/) API services.
It provides complete model service tools and full-chain application development kits for enterprise customers and individual developers, 
pre-installing rich capability plugins, providing convenient integration methods such as RAG and Assistant API, 
and efficiently completing the construction of large-scale model applications.


## üöÄ DashVector
[DashVector](https://www.aliyun.com/activity/intelligent/DashVector) is a fully-managed 
vectorDB service that supports 
high-dimension dense and sparse vectors, real-time insertion 
and filtered search. It is built to scale automatically and can 
adapt to different application requirements. It is currently
integrated into ü¶úÔ∏èüîó[LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/dashvector) as well.


# ‚ú®Examples
This repository will host examples for accomplishing various tasks by
leveraging the aforementioned API services. Most examples are presented
via Colab notebook and are executable _right out of the box_ (once you have the API-key 
for the underlying API services).
